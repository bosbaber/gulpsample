# A minimalistic gulp sample

Minimalistic example of how to use gulp as a web application builder.

## Getting started

### Requirements

This sample requires the package manager for javascript to be installed. This
tool is called 'npm'. In theory it should install with node. Google a bit to find
out how to install npm for your specific environment.

You will also need git to check out this source code.

### Check out sources
Check out this repository using git clone
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bosbaber/gulpsample
```

### Install dependencies using npm

```sh
npm install
```

### Run gulp
```sh
gulp
```
If gulp ran successfully then you should find a "dist" folder in your working
directory containing uglified javascipt. Also note that the html file has the
bundle.js reference injected.
